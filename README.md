### Game Deployment
The game will be published on https://paulhocker.itch.io/

### Game Development Tracking
Obviously the Source Code is here on GitHub. I will be keeping track of Tasks and Accomplishment using the wonderful [Trello](https://trello.com/b/gf6VbsxT/rogue-chomp).

### Game Assets
Because I am lazy I will not be doing Artwork, at least right at the beginning. Instead I chose some Assets that I can use from

http://opengameart.org

I found a cool set of Pac-Man like tiles that I can use which give a bit of a Roguelike feel as well. They were created by [drakzlin](https://opengameart.org/users/drakzlin) here
